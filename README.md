# Telco-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Kaggle dataset to be used in "Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Final Project"
### Dataset
This data is taken from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn.

### Context
"Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs." [IBM Sample Data Sets]

### Content
Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

### Inspiration
To explore this type of models and learn more about the subject.

### What do I need to install?
This project uses Python 3 and is designed to be completed through the Jupyter Notebooks IDE. It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy                                         
pandas                                                   
Matplotlib                                 
Seaborn                                                      

### Why this project?
Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that you will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. This understanding will help you approach any statistical analyses and will help you build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.
